# The website User Narration:

As a CMU student, user can find other CMU students nearby through the website. The customers should use their Andrew ID to login so that it can ensure all the users are CMU students.
First, user can use Andrew ID to login.
Then he/she can press “Refresh” button to get all the nearby students listed in a window. Some of them would have photos. User also can control who are displayed in the window, for example, only man/women, age below 30, or only display students who have photo.
If the user is interested in some students, he/she can send message to the student by tapping the “chat” button. This may open a new window to chat.
By pressing the “New message” button, user can view message sent to him/her when the user are offline.
By pressing the “Profile” button, the user can upload photo, record location, etc.

This system has two models:
1. Authentication model: This is used to confirm the user is a CMU student. The system can connect to CMU's system to confirm the student's Andrew account.

2. Searching model: This can search nearby students, the nearest students rank first on the list. This model should access the database, which store student’s name, location.

Users:
All the users are CMU students.

Interesting point：
As the system is restricted to CMU students, users can make friends with well-educated people.


Using condition:
As we should get the location, so the user should input his/her location. If this website runs on smartphone, it would be easier because the location can be got automatically.
